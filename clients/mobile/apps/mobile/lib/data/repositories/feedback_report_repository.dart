  /// The same liveness rule, for the same reason, as
  /// `HttpTurnFeedbackRepository.requestTimeout` — see its doc comment.
  /// `ApiClient` sets no timeout of its own and `dart:io`'s `HttpClient` has no
  /// default in-flight request timeout, so a half-open socket (a cellular/Wi-Fi
  /// handoff, not an exotic failure) leaves the request open until the OS tears
  /// the connection down.
  ///
  /// What expiry costs here is the whole point of bounding it. This path has no
  /// outbox: the sheet is the only place the user's typed report exists. An
  /// unbounded submit leaves that sheet spinning with Cancel, the text field,
  /// and Submit all disabled and no error — the only exit is the modal barrier,
  /// which disposes the controller and destroys the report with nothing to
  /// retry. A BOUNDED one fails like any other failed submit: the sheet stays
  /// open, the typed text is intact, and the error is retryable. That is the
  /// difference between a failed submit (which this feature's acceptance
  /// criteria allow for) and a hung one (which they do not).
  ///
  /// Expiry needs no new copy. `presentableErrorMessage` returns null for a
  /// [TimeoutException] — it is not an `ApiException` — so the sheet falls
  /// through to its existing generic retryable sentence, exactly as it does for
  /// a 5xx.
  ///
  /// The 30-second default is CHOSEN, not measured, and matches
  /// `HttpTurnFeedbackRepository`: it is a liveness bound on a stuck
  /// connection, not a latency budget.
  ///
  /// It does not cancel the request server-side, so an expired submit the
  /// server did accept files a DUPLICATE report if the user retries. Do not
  /// read that as a theoretical edge. `POST /api/v1/feedback/reports` creates
  /// a Linear issue through `@linear/sdk`, and `apps/web/src/lib/feedback/
  /// linear-client.ts` passes no `AbortSignal` and sets no timeout on the
  /// GraphQL call or on its one raw attachment `fetch` — so whenever Linear is
  /// slow, "the client gave up while the server went on to succeed" is the
  /// ORDINARY outcome, not an unlikely one, and the retry the sheet invites is
  /// what produces the second issue. Bounding the client is still the right
  /// trade against silently eating the report entirely, but the duplicate is
  /// the expected cost, not a remote one. A server-side
  /// `(userId, clientReportId)` upsert key is the actual fix and is tracked as
  /// a follow-up.
