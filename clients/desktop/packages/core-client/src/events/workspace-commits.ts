 * twice that. If all three fail the delivery is acknowledged so one broken
 * resource cannot hold back later commits, and a broad recovery is owed:
 * retried after `8 * retryDelayMs`, doubling per failure to a ceiling of
 * `128 * retryDelayMs`, until it applies. A file left corrupt costs one
 * broad re-read per ceiling, a fault that clears is re-read within one
 * ceiling, and a recovery owed again starts from the first delay. While the
 * recovery is owed, a delivery that needs a broad re-read (an invalidation
 * or a failed plan) is acknowledged at once; only a broad re-read queued
 * after it discharges the recovery, so a recovery already reading when one
 * arrives reads again as soon as it applies. The re-read on open follows the
