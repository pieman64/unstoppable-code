/**
 * User-gesture ledger for terminal keyboard focus (CAN-2309).

 * A terminal pane must take the caret ONLY when the user actually put it
 * there — clicking the pane, starting a terminal, or an explicit reveal.
 * Merely becoming the active/visible panel (workspace or task switch, panel
 * group expand/maximize/restore, session restart, cached pane remount) is not
 * a user gesture and must leave the caret where the user left it.
 *
 * Panes cannot infer that from their props, so the surfaces that DO know a
 * gesture happened record the intent here and the pane consumes it exactly
 * once. The revision counter exists so a pane that is already mounted and
 * selected still reacts to a reveal that arrives after mount.

 * in a different worktree entirely. No pane for that terminal is mounted then,
