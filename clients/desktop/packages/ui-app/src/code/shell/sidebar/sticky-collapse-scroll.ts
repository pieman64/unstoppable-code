/**
 * Collapsing a workspace while its sticky header is stuck (pinned below the
 * sidebar's sticky controls group, or already being pushed out) removes the
 * section's rows from flow, which would leave the collapsed header above the
 * sticky line — invisible behind the transparent controls group. Call this
 * before committing the collapse: it detects either the legacy sticky-header
 * offset or the current projected-slot ownership and, after the DOM updates,
 * corrects the viewport scroll so the collapsed header lands just below the
 * sticky controls — still visible instead of scrolled out at the top of the
 * view.
 *
 * The correction runs in a requestAnimationFrame callback (after the collapse
 * has committed and been laid out, before the next paint) and only when the
 * header actually ended up above the sticky line, so collapses that naturally
 * keep the header on screen are left untouched.
