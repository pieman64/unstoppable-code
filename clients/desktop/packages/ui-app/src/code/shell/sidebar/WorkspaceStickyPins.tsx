 *
 * The rail occludes in-flow rows beneath its transparent sticky band with a
 * scroll-driven clip, so a header cannot simply stick — it is clipped away
 * with everything else. The rail therefore reserves hosts above the clip and
 * expects whoever renders the rows to portal copies into them. A surface that
 * does not leaves that reserved band empty, which reads as an unexplained gap
 * under Projects rather than as a missing feature.
 *
 * Hosts are resolved in a layout effect rather than passed down: they belong
 * to the rail, are created before this renders, and looking them up keeps the
 * surface from having to thread four element refs through every list level.
