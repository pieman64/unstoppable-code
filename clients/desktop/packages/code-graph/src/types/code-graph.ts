// Bumped 4 -> 5: added the symbol FTS rowid map and empty W3 dependency-table
// schema. Existing graph facts are preserved; the ordinary engine build repairs
// both FTS indexes and publishes the map's schema/writer completion marker.
//
// Bumped 3 -> 4: index-only (partial edge target index, NOCASE symbol name
// index). A worktree graph migrates in place on its next build, which the
// scheduler requests because the stored schema version no longer matches;
// published bases with the old version are rejected and rebuilt.
//
// Bumped 2 -> 3: added the Unicode-folded trigram fragment index used by
// interactive symbol search so interior matches never scan every symbol.
// Existing graphs rebuild this derived index during their next graph build.
//
// Bumped 1 -> 2: added derived-analysis tables -- communities,
// community_memberships, flows, flow_memberships (Phase 6 Task 3; see
// store/migrations.ts's v2 migration) -- for the community detection and
// flow tracing that later Phase 6 tasks compute. Purely additive: no v1
// table or column changed, so an existing v1 database migrates in place
// with zero data loss, and store/migrations.ts's schema_version-vs-migrations
// out-of-sync guard still holds (the last migration's version and this
// constant stay in lockstep).
//
// CODE_GRAPH_EXTRACTOR_VERSION below has its own INDEPENDENT bump history --
// it tracks parser/extraction behavior changes (what facts get produced),
// not table schema changes (where facts get stored). The two version
// numbers are unrelated and are not expected to move together.
// Bumped 1 -> 2: corpus widened to non-code inputs (markdown, package.json,
// tsconfig*.json, mcp-config are now enumerated and extracted alongside
// grammar-backed source files). A stale extractor_version metadata value
// forces a full reparse so previously-built graphs pick up the new non-code
// file records.
//
// Bumped 2 -> 3: canopy-pattern extraction added (IPC channel declarations,
// IPC_HANDLES/IPC_INVOKES call-site edges, and injected-tool-registry
// mcp_tool/DECLARES_MCP_TOOL facts -- see extract/canopy-patterns.ts). A
// stale value forces a full reparse so previously-built graphs pick up these
// new facts. NOTE: Phase 5 Task 1 (ontology widening) deliberately left this
// at 2 with no bump -- it only widened the symbol/edge kind type surface,
// with no extraction behavior change -- so Task 2 (this bump) is the first
// real behavior change since 2. This is ONE bump, not two: nothing between
// Task 1 and this change justifies landing on 4.
//
// Bumped 3 -> 4: channel-registry extraction generalized from the single
// literal `IPC_CHANNELS` to any top-level `export const <NAME>` matching
// /^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*_CHANNELS$/ (SKILLS_CHANNELS, PLUGINS_CHANNELS,
// PIPELINE_CHANNELS, ...), with the registry constant name recorded in
// symbol `extra` / edge `evidence`. A stale value forces a full reparse so
// previously-built graphs pick up the secondary-registry channel symbols and
// their handler/invoker edges.
// Bumped 5 -> 6: Swift declarations, Prisma schema facts, Markdown reference
// links and relative config inheritance require re-extracting existing files.
