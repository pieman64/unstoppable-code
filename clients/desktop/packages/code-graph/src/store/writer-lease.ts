/**
 * The cross-process writer lease for one worktree graph database. Every
 * process that writes a worktree `graph.db` (the build host for builds, seeds,
 * summary repairs, derived analysis and the end-of-build fingerprint; the CLI
 * for builds, snapshot imports and schema migrations) holds this lease for the
 * whole write, so one writer owns the database at a time.
 *
 * The lease is a reserved lock on a sidecar SQLite file beside the graph. The
 * operating system drops the lock when its process exits, so a crashed holder
 * never leaves a stale lease behind. The sidecar is never written or deleted:
 * replacing it while it is held would let a second process lock the new file.
 * Immutable published base generations and private staging databases have a
 * single writer by construction and take no lease.
