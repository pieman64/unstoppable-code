/**
 * Channel-level IPC transport shared by the portable CanopyClient adapter
 * (`@canopy/ipc-canopy-client`) and the hosts that carry it: the desktop
 * preload bridge, the browser direct-control worker and hosted MCP sessions
 * (`@canopy/remote-session`).
 *
 * - `invoke` resolves with the host handler's result or rejects with the
 *   host's error. A transport never replays an invoke after a disconnect: one
 *   in flight when the connection drops rejects with
 *   {@link RemoteTransportDisconnectedError}, and its outcome is unknown.
 * - `send` is fire-and-forget. While disconnected it is dropped, not queued.
 * - `on` adds a push listener for one channel. The returned function removes
 *   it and may be called more than once. Listeners stay registered across a
 *   reconnect; the owner resubscribes host-side interest itself.
