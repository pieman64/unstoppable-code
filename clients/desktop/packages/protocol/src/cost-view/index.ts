// View contracts for reading the observed cost of one work scope: the Cost
// panel, the Session breakdown, a pipeline run's cost and the usage popover's
// preview.
//
// These are portable DTOs. They carry logical IDs only (projects, worktrees,
// Work Entries, chats, pipeline executions, retained containers), never host
// paths, and never prompts, replies, summaries, errors or tool input. The
// `core.cost.*` operations validate the same shapes.
//
// Dependency-free like the rest of `@canopy/protocol`: safe to import from the
// desktop main process, the renderer and the web app.
