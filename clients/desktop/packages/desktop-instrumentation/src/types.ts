/**
 * The seam through which a renderer publishes its current synthetic screen
 * route (see `./posthog-routes`) to the instrumentation client.
 *
 * This is an IN-PROCESS interface within a single renderer process — not an
 * IPC contract. There is no persisted route history and no cross-window
 * sharing; each renderer supplies its own source and is the sole authority for
 * its own route.
 *
 * Contract both sides must honor:
 *
 * - `getSnapshot()` is **synchronous, total, and cheap**. It always returns a
 *   valid catalog member. It never returns `undefined`, never throws, and must
 *   stay allocation-light: the consumer calls it during SDK initialization and
 *   the producer derives it on store updates that can fire at streaming-token
 *   frequency.
 *
 * - `subscribe()` notifies **only on a changed final route string**.
 *   Deduplication is the producer's responsibility. The consumer may therefore
 *   assume every notification is a real A→B transition and emit a
 *   `$pageleave`/`$pageview` pair per notification without re-comparing.
 *   Repeated A→A updates must emit nothing.
 *
 * - `subscribe()` returns an **idempotent unsubscribe**. Calling it more than
 *   once is safe and has no further effect.
 *
 * - **The consumer owns the subscription lifetime.** SDK initialization
 *   subscribes; SDK disposal unsubscribes. When instrumentation is disabled
 *   the consumer must not subscribe at all, so disabled instrumentation
 *   installs no ongoing tracking.
 *
 * - **A missing source means existing behavior.** When
 *   `DesktopInstrumentationClientInitOptions.posthogRoutes` is absent, the
 *   client keeps its current safe-surface fallback (`app://main` /
 *   `app://app-advisor` derived from `surface`) with no behavior change. Node
 *   and background callers pass nothing.
