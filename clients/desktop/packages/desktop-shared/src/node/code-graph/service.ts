/**
 * Per-worktree owner of {@link CodeGraphEngine} instances.
 *
 * `CodeGraphEngine.open()` runs a best-effort `git rev-parse` per repository
 * plus a full migration pass — cheap, but not free, so open engines are
 * cached (keyed `${workspaceId}/${worktreeId}`) as a `Promise<CodeGraphEngine>`:
 * concurrent `getEngine` calls for the same worktree share one open, and a
 * rejected open is evicted from the cache so the next call retries instead of
 * replaying the same failure forever.
 *
 * `buildOrUpdate` chains onto a per-key promise queue so two callers never run
 * `engine.buildOrUpdate()` concurrently against the same sqlite database
 * (Phase 1's engine has no reentrancy guard of its own) — including across a
 * close: builds issued while a close is in flight seed their fresh queue
 * chained *behind* that close, so they run strictly after it completes. The
 * queue tail is normalized to always resolve — a failed build is reported to
 * its own caller but never poisons the queue for subsequent callers on the
 * same key.
 *
 * Close guarantee: when `closeWorktree`/`closeAll` resolves, every engine this
 * service opened for the key up to that point has been closed — the close
 * evicts both map entries synchronously, drains the old queue tail, and then
 * closes both the originally cached engine and any engine that old-queue work
 * re-cached while draining. An in-flight close is tracked in `closing`;
 * `getEngine` waits for it before touching the cache and `buildOrUpdate`
 * queues behind it, so work issued mid-close can only reopen after the close
 * completes (such post-close reopens are new work and stay open). Old-queue
 * build bodies intentionally use the close-gate-free {@link getEngineInternal}
 * — the close awaits them, so gating them on the close would deadlock.
 *
 * Descriptor `repositories` may legitimately change between calls (e.g. a repo
 * added to a multi-repo workspace); `getEngine` intentionally keeps serving
 * the cached engine in that case. Picking up a changed repository set
 * requires the caller to `closeWorktree` first so the next `getEngine` reopens
 * with the new descriptor — that reconciliation is not solved here.
