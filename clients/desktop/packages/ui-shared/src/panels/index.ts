/**
 * Canopy panels engine, ported from VS Code OSS (commit c4632cac).
 *
 * Framework-agnostic layout/geometry primitives shared by the desktop app and
 * the web app: sash (draggable divider), split view (1D resizable split), grid
 * (recursive 2D split tree with serialization), drag-and-drop observation,
 * drop-zone geometry, and the in-process drag transfer singleton.
 *
 * This subtree must stay pure: no React, no stores, no `window.api`, no
 * Electron, no Node APIs, and no runtime dependencies (type-only imports of
 * `@canopy/protocol` wire unions are allowed — they erase at compile time).
 * Serialized grid shapes are engine-level and unversioned; persist them
 * wrapped in the versioned envelope defined in `@canopy/protocol`.
