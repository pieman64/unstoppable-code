/**
 * Canonical visual treatment for a sidebar list item.
 *
 * Lifted out of the desktop renderer's `sidebar-styles.ts` so the desktop
 * sidebar and the shared `SidebarSurface` the web portal renders describe a
 * row the same way. They had drifted into two vocabularies for one control —
 * the portal drew idle rows `fg-secondary` against desktop's `fg-primary`, and
 * an active row as `bg-accent-subtle fg-accent` against desktop's neutral
 * `bg-muted fg-primary`, so the same navigation read as grey links with one
 * green item on web and as white links with a selected pill on desktop.
 *
 * These are class-name constants rather than a component on purpose: the two
 * hosts still build their own rows (desktop's `SidebarNavRow`, the portal's
 * `SidebarNavItemRow`) because their click/routing seams differ. Sharing the
 * appearance is the part that has to agree, and it is the part that silently
 * diverges.

 * takes exactly this spot and the pin icon beside it stays put when the row's
 * buttons appear. Text sits right-aligned 4px inside the cell, off the row's
 * very edge. The rare labels wider than 24px (`11mo`, `12mo`, `999`, about
