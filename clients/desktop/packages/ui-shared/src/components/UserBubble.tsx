  // PHONE-TIER GEOMETRY. At 390px a full-width tinted, ringed shell sitting
  // directly above the composer reads as a second composer rather than as
  // something the user said: same width, same corner radius, same surface
  // family, a few pixels apart. Shrinking the surface to its content and
  // pushing it flush right restores the one authorship cue a phone transcript
  // still has room for — which side of the column a message sits on.
  //
  // APPLIED TO THE WRAPPER, NOT THE BUBBLE. The wrapper is the positioning
  // context for the corner badges AND the box `footer` lays out in, so shrinking
  // only the inner bubble right-aligns the bubble while leaving its own
  // decorations behind at full column width: the `leading` badge
  // (`absolute -left-2`) strands itself at the far left of the transcript, and
  // the `footer` attachment chips stay left-aligned under a right-aligned
  // message. Shrinking the wrapper moves all four together — badge cluster,
  // leading badge, bubble, footer — which is the only way they stay one object.
  //
  // A block-level box with `width: fit-content` and `margin-left: auto` right-
  // aligns on its own, so this stays a plain block rather than becoming a flex
  // parent (which would re-lay-out the children it is meant to leave alone).
  //
  // The 85% cap is what makes a long message wrap instead of running edge to
  // edge — an uncapped `w-fit` message long enough to fill the column comes
  // out full width again and silently loses the cue on exactly the messages
  // that most need it.
  //
  // Tier-gated rather than written as a `sm:`-prefixed utility on purpose: the
  // tablet and desktop class strings must come out byte-identical to what they
  // were.
  //
  // WHICH DESKTOP SURFACES THIS REACHES. The gate is viewport-based, not
  // host-based, so "the Electron renderer is inert" is only true where the
  // renderer cannot be narrow enough to match. The desktop main window sets
  // `minWidth: 800` (`apps/desktop-app/src/main/index.ts`), so the Code tab
  // never matches the phone query and is genuinely unaffected. The App Advisor
  // popout sets `APP_ADVISOR_MIN_WIDTH = 360` and renders this component
  // through `PanelGridSurface` -> chat panels -> `ChatMessageItem`, so between
  // 360px and 639px it DOES get this treatment. That is intended rather than
  // incidental: a 400px popout has exactly the problem described above — a
  // full-width tinted shell directly above the composer reads as a second
  // composer, and the `-right-2` badge overhang clips against the panel edge —
  // so the same geometry is the right answer there for the same reason.
  //
  // PULL-OUT PANEL WINDOWS are the one realm this does NOT follow into, and it
  // is worth recording why rather than leaving it to be rediscovered.
  // `useLayoutTier` reads the GLOBAL `window.matchMedia`, while this package's
  // `panels/window-registry` rule is that DOM-touching code must use the owning
  // window of the element it works with. A narrow aux window would therefore
  // read the MAIN window's tier, not its own. That is inert today only because
  // the main window's `minWidth: 800` keeps `useIsPhone()` permanently false in
  // that realm — so if the main window's minimum ever drops below 640, or an
  // aux window ever needs its own tier, `useMediaQuery` needs a window-scoped
  // `matchMedia` before this gate can be trusted there.
  const phoneSurfaceClass = isPhone ? ' ml-auto w-fit max-w-17/20' : '';

  // ACTION BADGES. Two independent axes meet on this one element, and it is
  // worth being explicit about which is which.
  //
  // POSITION is width-dependent. The corner overhang (`-right-2 -top-2`) is
  // only safe while the bubble spans the column and has the transcript's own
  // horizontal padding to spill into. Once the phone bubble is flush right,
  // that same -8px puts the cluster past the transcript's edge, where it
  // clips. On the phone tier it therefore sits inside the bubble's own bounds.
  //
  // VISIBILITY is pointer-dependent, not width-dependent, so it is not tier
  // gated. `opacity-0` + `group-hover:opacity-100` has no coarse-pointer
  // escape, and a touch device has no hover — meaning that on a phone, a
  // tablet, or a touchscreen laptop there is simply no way to reach Copy or
  // Revert on a user message. `pointer-coarse:opacity-100` is the same escape
  // `ChatTab` already carries on its close button; reusing that idiom keeps
  // the two from drifting apart.
  //
  // Both candidates are spelled out literally so Tailwind's scanner emits
  // them.
  //
  // `actionsOnCorner` keeps the corner overhang at every tier: the host
  // vouches that its transcript's horizontal padding (16px on the desktop and
  // the App Advisor panel) leaves room for it beside a flush-right bubble.
  // The clean chat look keeps the same corner badges: a row under the bubble
  // sat beside the turn's "Worked for" line and read as a stray control.
  // Keyboard focus reveals them too, so a tabbed-to badge is never invisible.
  const badgeClusterClass =
    isPhone && !actionsOnCorner

  // CLEARANCE FOR THE IN-BUBBLE CLUSTER. Once the cluster moves inside the
  // bubble's bounds on the phone tier, it overlaps the text: the bubble shrinks
  // to its content, so a short message's first line runs straight underneath
  // the Copy (and Revert) badges, and on a touch device those badges are
  // permanently visible via `pointer-coarse:opacity-100` rather than appearing
  // on hover. Reserving the cluster's width as right padding is what keeps the
  // first line clear.
  //
  // The arithmetic, so it stays correct if the badges are resized: each badge is
  // `h-7 w-7` (28px) with a `gap-1` (4px) between them, and the cluster is
  // inset `right-1` (4px). One badge therefore needs 4 + 28 = 32px of clearance
  // and two need 4 + 28 + 4 + 28 = 64px; the values below add the surface's own
  // 4px breathing room on top. Copy is always rendered, so the one-badge case is
  // the floor rather than zero.
  //
  // Padding applies to the whole box, so a message long enough to wrap carries
  // the reservation on every line, not just the one that needs it. That is the
  // deliberate trade: a float/`shape-outside` spacer would confine it to the
  // first line at the cost of a layout-affecting element inside the content box,
  // which is exactly what the `w-fit` geometry above is sensitive to.
  //
  // Both candidates are spelled out literally so Tailwind's scanner emits them.
