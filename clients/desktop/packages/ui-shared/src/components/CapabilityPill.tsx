/**
 * Renders one shared-container capability token as a friendly pill.
 *
 * The recipient list used to render `grant.capabilities.join(', ')`, which put
 * raw server tokens (`VIEW`) in front of the owner. That rawness was
 * deliberate - a container that grows a capability beyond `VIEW` must render
 * without a desktop code change - so this component preserves the intent
 * rather than replacing it: a known token gets a friendly label, and an
 * unknown one falls back to title case instead of disappearing or throwing.
 *
 * There is no single-capability assumption anywhere here. Callers map over the
 * grant's array and render one pill per capability.
 *
 * Shape and metrics come from `StatusPill` rather than being restated here, so
 * this and `ViewOnlyPill` stay one visual family by construction.
