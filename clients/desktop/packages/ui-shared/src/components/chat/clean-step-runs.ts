 * The clean chat look groups a turn's work between two replies into one
 * line. Hosts flatten their transcript into units (a message, or a piece of
 * one) and say what each unit is:
 *
 * - `step`: agent work that folds into the run (a tool call, failed ones
 *   included, a thought, a helper agent, a question still being asked);
 * - `silent`: draws nothing (an empty thinking shell, a blank text block),
 *   so it joins whatever run it sits in without splitting it;
 * - `break`: something the person reads or acts on (a reply, an answered
 *   question, a plan, a visual, an app notice), which ends the run.
 *
 * Every run of steps becomes one segment, however short, so a turn reads
 * "reply, one line of work, reply" rather than a list of rows.
