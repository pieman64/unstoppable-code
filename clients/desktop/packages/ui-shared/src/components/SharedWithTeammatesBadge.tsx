/**
 * The "shared with teammates" glyph, identical on code-worktree and Cowork
 * rows.
 *
 * Persistent metadata, not an activity subject: it never enters the leading
 * icon's priority chain, so a shared row still shows its live status glyph.
 *
 * Note on {@link SharedWithTeammatesBadgeProps.fadeOnRowHover}: on that path the
 * badge is invisible precisely when the pointer is over the row, so a hover
 * tooltip is unreachable no matter what — the glyph fades on the same
 * `group-hover` that would open it. It is also made inert, so the faded-out
 * glyph can never swallow a click aimed at the ••• button that now occupies the
 * same pixels. Because both of those hold, the tooltip is skipped outright
 * rather than mounted and blocked, which drops the wrapper `<span>` and the
 * `cloneElement` per shared row. (`RichHoverTooltip`'s `disabled` return sits
 * after its hooks, so the `useId`/state/refs still run — the correctness
 * argument is what carries this decision, not the saving.) The accessible name
 * is unaffected — it lives on the glyph's
 * `aria-label`, not in the tooltip. Hosts that render without the fade keep the
 * real tooltip.
