 *
 * See `./RowActions.tsx` for the hover-revealed, absolutely positioned
 * `RowActionTray` / `RowActionButton` used by sidebar and attachment rows.
 * The two are deliberately separate: overloading one control would force the
 * tray's hover-only destructive styling and opt-in focus ring onto tables.

 * Consumers: the Automations page tables and the Pipelines management table.
