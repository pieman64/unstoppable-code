/**
 * Generic dismissible CTA pill with a rich anchored popover.
 *
 * Mounts inside the in-app notification stack alongside `GuestUpgradeNudge`
 * and the toasts, so it follows the user's corner placement preference.
 *
 * **No auto-dismiss.** Unlike the toasts it sits next to, this pill never
 * schedules its own removal — visibility is entirely the caller's, via
 * `onDismiss` plus whatever gate the adapter applies. A toast that expires is
 * recoverable from notification history; this pill has no history entry, so a
 * timeout would be a silent loss, and auto-hiding would fight the popover by
 * yanking a QR code out from under a phone camera mid-scan. Do not add a
 * `durationMs` prop or an internal timer here; a future consumer that wants
 * toast-like expiry owns that timer itself.
 *
 * Popover open state lives here (`useState`); callers only observe it through
 * `onPopoverOpenChange`. Interaction state inside ui-shared is established
 * precedent (`FloatingMenu`, `Sheet`).
 *
 * `FloatingMenu` owns dismissal (Escape, outside click), the z-layer
 * (`--layer-floating-menu`), and focus restore back to the action button. Do
 * not add a second Escape path. Collision flipping means the default
 * `top-center` placement resolves itself for top-corner notification
 * placements without any plumbing here.
 *
 * Dismissing drops focus to `<body>`, which is accepted: the pill is an
 * unsolicited interruption in a notification stack, not a navigation step, so
 * there is no "place" in the tab order to return the user to. `FloatingMenu`
 * still restores focus to the action button when only the popover closes.
 *
 * **The pill sizes to its copy** (`w-max`) instead of to its container. It
 * renders in a fixed-width notification column (24rem in the desktop shell),
 * and a flex child with `width: auto` stretches to fill that column — which
 * left the message ellipsised inside a pill that had no more room to give.
 * `truncate` survives as the last resort for a window too narrow for the
 * copy, not as the normal state.
 *
 * `w-max`, not `w-fit`: `fit-content` clamps to the containing block, so a
 * pill whose copy outgrows the column would still truncate at 24rem. The pill
 * is a floating overlay, so it may exceed the column and grow across the app
 * behind it; the cap is the viewport (matching the stack's 1rem inset on each
 * side), which is the point past which growing would clip instead of overlap.
 *
 * A definite width also opts the pill out of flex's `stretch` default, which
 * falls back to flex-start, so `align` (not the parent's `align-items`) is
 * what keeps it against the correct edge of a corner-anchored stack — and is
 * what makes the overflow spill inward, away from that edge.
 *
 * `interaction="manual"` alone would leave the popover pointer-only — it keeps
 * focus on the trigger and closes on any Tab — so this opts into `trapFocus`
 * (focus lands inside on open, Tab cycles within) and hands `FloatingMenu` the
 * banner root as the outside-press boundary so the sibling dismiss X still
 * fires on the first click while the popover is open.
