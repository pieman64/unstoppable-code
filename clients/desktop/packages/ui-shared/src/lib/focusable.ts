/**
 * The shared definition of "focusable" used by `DialogModal` and
 * `FloatingMenu`.
 *
 * Not yet every focus-managing surface in the package — `WorktreeDialogs` still
 * carries its own selector with different rules. Folding it in is worthwhile
 * but is not this change's business.
 *
 * There used to be two: `FloatingMenu`'s and `DialogModal`'s, with quietly
 * different rules — one excluded `aria-disabled="true"`, the other did not; one
 * read the `tabindex` attribute, the other the `tabIndex` property (which
 * reports 0 for a `<button>` with no attribute, so the two disagree about
 * plain buttons the moment anything sets `tabindex="-1"` dynamically). Two
 * focus traps in one package that disagree about what is focusable will drift,
 * and the symptom is a surface that traps Tab onto nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than a full focusability check: this answers "what are
 * the Tab stops inside this surface", not "what could receive focus at all".
 * A stop hidden inside the surface (a kept-mounted page under `hidden`, an
 * `invisible` wrapper) is not one.
