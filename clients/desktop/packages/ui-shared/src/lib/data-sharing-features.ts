//
// The scope labels (`Usage metadata`, `Plans`, `Session summaries`,
// `Transcripts`) are abstract, and the blast radius is wildly uneven: turning
// off Usage metadata guts most of the product, while turning off Transcripts
// costs two features. Nobody can infer that from the labels, so every scope row
// carries a row of feature pills that state plainly what it powers — and flips
// to a "this is what you lose" treatment when the scope is off.
//
// Pills name FEATURES, not capabilities, and the vocabulary is a closed set
// ({@link DataSharingFeatureId}). A pill is always a product surface the user
// already knows by name; it never describes the mechanism ("Worktree updates in
// Feed", "Summary history", "Memory source transcripts" are all capability
// phrasings and are out). The same feature may appear on several rows — that is
// expected and is itself informative, because it tells the reader a feature
// DEGRADES rather than disappears when one of its inputs is off.

 * - **Usage metadata is a hard prerequisite for Organization memory**, because
