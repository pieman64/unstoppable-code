/**
 * Last input modality per document, so focus handlers can apply native
 * `:focus-visible` semantics: react to focus that the user reached by keyboard
 * (Tab, arrows, Enter/Space, Escape …), never to focus that followed a pointer
 * press or that a script moved with `.focus()`.
 *
 * Why not `element.matches(':focus-visible')`? Two reasons. jsdom matches it
 * for every focused element, so tests could never tell keyboard focus from
 * programmatic focus. And Chromium matches it for programmatic focus that
 * happens before any user interaction (page load, `autofocus`), which is
 * precisely the case tooltip triggers must stay quiet for. Tracking the
 * user's last input event is the reliable signal, so it is authoritative here.
 *
 * Tracking installs once per `Document`, in the capture phase so a bubbling
 * listener that stops propagation cannot starve it. Components that consult
 * `wasFocusVisible` call `trackInputModality` when they mount: the first query
 * also installs it, but by then the Tab press that caused that first focus has
 * already happened and would be missed. Keydowns carrying
 * Ctrl/Meta/Alt are app shortcuts rather than focus navigation and are ignored,
 * mirroring the `:focus-visible` heuristic. Once the user is driving by
 * keyboard, scripted focus moves (a menu returning focus to its trigger after
 * Escape) still count as visible until the pointer is used again — the same
 * rule browsers apply.
