 * The squared control every public `/share/*` lander uses instead of the app

 * app chrome. One recipe serves a lander's plain buttons and links and the
 * busy `LoadingButton` (`presentation="share-lander"`), so the two cannot
 * drift. Lives on the component-free `lib` subpath because the landers'
 * server-rendered pages read it too.
