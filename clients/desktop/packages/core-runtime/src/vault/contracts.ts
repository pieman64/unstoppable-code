/**
 * Family-scoped capability minted ONLY by trusted composition, then injected
 * into its designated domain writer. No caller-supplied writer ID, public
 * minting method or V0 family-to-writer mapping. The implementation closes over
 * the family: copying/changing this descriptive property cannot widen access.
 * A create for another family or replace/delete of another family's ref returns
 * refused{managed_family}, before admission or durability changes.
 *
 * Acceptance writes a durable closure intent synchronously, inside put/delete;
 * it survives a restart. If it cannot be written, the call is
 * refused{closure_unrecorded} before acceptance. A put while the vault key is
 * not held is blocked before acceptance; a delete needs no key.
 *
 * An accepted, CAS-matching replace/delete closes admission synchronously,
 * before the returned promise or any further durability work. No revision is
 * readable while pending. A failed/uncertain delete stays closed, across a
 * restart. An unavailable replace also stays closed, until a same-key retry
 * or new put durably confirms a successor.
 * An uncertain mutation stays unconfirmed until V1 reconciliation, never a
 * not_found/expired result and never fallback to an earlier revision.
 * A different put against a pending, uncertain or revoked entry is refused
 * with entry_closed before acceptance: no durability work, admission change
 * or idempotency key reservation. Accepted same-key retries still join/replay.
 * A CAS-matching delete also closes a pending/uncertain mutation immediately;
 * it is never refused with entry_closed. It supersedes that mutation: late
 * completion, reconciliation and same-key replay cannot publish its candidate or pin.
 * The delete's own durability outcome controls the closed entry. An unknown
 * delete needs V1 reconciliation; an unavailable delete allows a same-key
 * retry. A new create uses a new ref, never reopens the revoked ref.
 *
 * Committed means durably confirmed, not merely queued. Entry IDs are minted
 * by the store and never reissued; revisions start fresh at create. A deleted
 * ref reads deleted until V1 removes its tombstone, then absent.
 *
 * Accepted keys are scoped to this family and vault, shared by put/delete.
 * Identical retries join/replay; changed input is idempotency_conflict without effects.
 * Replay cannot reopen admission or supersede later writes. Invalid requests
 * reject with TypeError before effects (wire bounds, plus binary material).
 *
 * Every not-accepted outcome (TypeError, refused, not_found, revision_conflict,
 * idempotency_conflict, blocked) has the same effect whichever check fires: no
 * durable effect, admission change or key reservation. The one exception, a
 * delete's closure_unrecorded failing closed in-process, is reported only when
 * every other check accepts the delete. When several apply, this order decides
 * only which one is reported: validation, managed_family, not_found,
 * idempotency replay/conflict, entry_closed, revision_conflict, blocked,
 * closure_unrecorded. An accepted key replays its retained outcome even if its
 * ref now reads deleted; not_found refuses only a key never accepted. A
 * retained unavailable is re-attempted instead, unless a later accepted delete
 * superseded it; entry_closed and revision_conflict still apply, and the
 * re-attempt reuses its durable intent, so it is never closure_unrecorded.
 * While the key is not held, a put's retry returns that unavailable, never blocked.
