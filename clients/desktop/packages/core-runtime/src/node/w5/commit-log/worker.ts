/*
 * The W5 commit log worker: a thread inside its host process that holds the
 * commit log's only connection, so synchronous SQLite stays off the host's
 * event loop (CAN-3805). It opens the log, runs launch recovery, reports
 * `ready` or `openFailed`, and then runs each request to completion before it
 * starts the next, so commits and their file writes never interleave.
 *
 * The host stops it with `Worker.terminate()`. Node closes the connection as
 * it tears down the thread, which releases the exclusive lock for the next
 * opener; a commit whose files were not yet written is finished by the next
 * worker's recovery.
 *
 * Nothing here logs. Error messages are fixed text or the commit log's own,
 * which carry no file contents. Each host's worker entry supplies its
 * durability, trusted OS and, on win32, its handle-confined reader; this body
 * reads no platform.
