/*
 * The initiated-work engine (CAN-4144). A source (hooks first; automations
 * and watchers later) submits each occurrence it fires. The engine records
 * the occurrence as a `core.initiatedWork.run` operation with its source,
 * occurrence identity and owner; applies the source's admission gates, the
 * occurrence deduplication and the one-run-per-target queue; and records how
 * every gate decided, the artifacts the run produced and how it ended.
 * Execution stays with the source's executor until CAN-4146.
 *
 * Firing is at least once (CAN-4145, ADR 14). A source that detects events
 * from durable state records the state it has seen and the runs it accepted
 * in one ledger transaction (`acceptOccurrence`), then starts them
 * (`runAccepted`). After a restart, accepted runs that never started resume
 * in their accepted order once their source revalidates them; possibly
 * started runs are reconciled by their identity, never started again.
