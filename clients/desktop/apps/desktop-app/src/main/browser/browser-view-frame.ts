/**
 * The Browser page's frame in its host window.
 *
 * The page fills its card's body edge to edge: flush under the toolbar with
 * square top corners, rounded only where it meets the card's own rounded
 * corners. A native view paints over the renderer, so no CSS clip reaches it,
 * and Electron rounds a view's four corners alike. So the page sits in a
 * rounded `clip` view that reaches past the page on each side whose corners
 * stay square, which pushes those rounded corners out of sight. The `frame`
 * around it is cut to the page area exactly, so the reach never covers (or
 * takes input from) the toolbar or the card around the page.

 *
