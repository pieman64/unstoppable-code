 * workspace/worktree/turn envelope the run rows are attached to IS metadata —
 * with it prohibited there is no row for the grant to reference. A `plans`

 * Resolve whether an org prohibition blocks run sharing.
 *
 * Run sharing is a first-class org transcript path, not an edge case: it
 * bypasses the ambient telemetry gate by design, defaults to `organization`
 * scope, and captures at higher fidelity than ambient sync. Without this gate a
 * transcripts prohibition would be one click away from being bypassed by any
 * member, which is exactly what makes it worth enforcing at the eligibility
 * probe rather than only at upload time.
 *
 * Fail closed: a read failure blocks the share and is recorded because "the
 * local gate silently stopped running" is otherwise indistinguishable from
 * "the owner org permits this".
 * The diagnostic is app-scoped, not session-scoped: the failure is in the
 * policy-state read, not in this worktree's transcript capture.
 *
 * `targetOrganizationId` adds the second, per-org reason (CAN-2311): an org
 * that has lost the `teams` capability can no longer receive shared runs. It is
 * deliberately keyed by the SHARE'S TARGET org rather than "any org the user
 * belongs to" — a member of one lapsed org and one healthy org must still be
 * able to share into the healthy one, and a private-scope share (no target org
 * at all) is never affected. The two report through DIFFERENT reasons
 * (`blocked-by-org-policy` vs `blocked-by-org-billing`): both are
 * organization-side conditions only an admin can lift, but they name different
 * remedies, and telling a lapsed org that its data sharing is "blocked" is
 * false.
