/**
 * Applies one Zoom In / Zoom Out / Actual Size command from the View menu.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT Electron's `zoomIn`/`zoomOut`/`resetZoom` menu roles:
 * those move `webContents` zoom directly and never touch `uiScale`, so the
 * live zoom would drift away from the saved preference and the next
 * `preferences:save`, window reload or `did-finish-load` would silently
 * revert it. Stepping the preference instead keeps the Display slider, the
 * shortcuts and every open window (main, App Advisor, panel pull-outs) in
 * agreement — this is the same persist → fan out → broadcast sequence the
 * slider's `savePreferences({ uiScale })` takes.
 *
 * Resolves to the scale now in effect. A command that cannot move the scale
 * (Zoom In at 200%, Actual Size at 100%) commits nothing and skips the fan
 * out, so holding a shortcut at the end of the range costs no writes.
