// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Background poll for new comments on shared runs (CAN-397).
//
// The desktop deliberately does NOT open an SSE connection from Electron main.
// Comments are server-authoritative and low-frequency, so a bounded poll (slow
// interval + an app-focus trigger) is the delivery mechanism in production.
//
// Shape follows two existing precedents:
//   - `org-enforced-settings.ts`: module-level unref'd timer, double-start
//     guard, self-gating on signed-in state, never throws.
//   - `shared-run-auto-updater.ts`: records a session diagnostic on failure
//     instead of surfacing an error.
//
// Bounded on purpose: only sessions registered at share time are candidates,
// at most `MAX_RUNS_PER_TICK` are polled per tick, and the whole tick short
// circuits when the connected Canopy Cloud does not advertise
// `run-comments-v1`. The per-tick window ROTATES through the registry, so a
// bounded tick throttles the poll without ever starving an entry.
//
// Liveness comes from the fetch (a 404/410 unregisters the entry) rather than
// from re-parsing each session's chat-tabs file, which carries whole
// transcripts and would put a multi-MB `JSON.parse` per entry on the Electron
// main thread every tick.
