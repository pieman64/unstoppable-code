/**
 * GitHub owner avatars for single-repo projects, projected onto the session
 * snapshot's workspace rows (`avatarUrl`) so the shared sidebar rail — on the
 * desktop and in the web portal alike — can draw them on project headers.
 *
 * Snapshot construction never waits on git: a read answers from this
 * process-lifetime cache, and a miss or a due entry schedules a serialized
 * `git remote get-url origin` in the background. When a lookup changes the
 * answer, the structural-sync signal republishes the snapshot (desktop rail
 * invalidation plus the portal overview push), which then reads the hit.
 *
 * Only a definite answer changes a cached avatar: a confirmed absent origin
 * or a non-GitHub one clears it, while an operational git failure (a lock, a
 * timeout) keeps the last answer and retries after a short backoff.
