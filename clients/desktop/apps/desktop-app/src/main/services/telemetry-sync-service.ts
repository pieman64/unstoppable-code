// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Centralized telemetry sync service (CAN-402).
//
// This main-process singleton packages per-turn telemetry (plus plans, PR
// status, and the worktree summary), scrubs secrets before anything leaves the
// machine, uploads through a durable queue, tracks returned server IDs so
// restarted turns / changed artifacts amend rather than duplicate, and stays
// off by default until a scope is opted in.
//
// Privacy invariant: every free-text field is redacted by the pure mappers in
// `@canopy/desktop-shared/lib/telemetry-mapping` before it enters a payload.
//
// Gate model (CAN-403 per-data-type opt-in, `PreferencesData.telemetrySharing`).
// Each data type has its own visibility (`off | private | team | organization`):
//   - `metadata`    governs the per-turn record (token/cost/timing/tool rollups),
//                   pull-request status, and the workspace/worktree envelope.
//   - `transcripts` governs the encrypted turn body. A turn row carries body and
//                   metadata under ONE owner scope server-side, so the body only
//                   rides along when `transcripts` resolves to the SAME scope as
//                   `metadata`. Enabling `transcripts` while `metadata` is off (or
//                   at a different scope) uploads nothing for transcripts — a
//                   transcript cannot exist without its (metadata-owned) turn row.
//   - `plans`       governs plan records.
//   - `summaries`   governs the AI-written worktree recaps: the latest-pointer
//                   `worktree.summary` and the `summaries[]` snapshot history.
//                   Split out of `metadata` so a transcripts prohibition is not
//                   undermined by conversation-derived prose. Like the turn
//                   body, the summary rides the worktree ENVELOPE rather than
//                   standing alone, so it only attaches when `summaries`
//                   resolves to the SAME scope as `metadata` — `metadata` is a
//                   hard prerequisite. Deliberately NOT its own envelope group
//                   the way `plans` has one.
//
// Effective sharing starts with stored preferences; no plan floor applies.
// At ingress and again at delivery, the work's governing organization is
// resolved and only that organization's required/prohibited policy is applied.
// Personal work, Personal Cowork, and App Advisor have no governing
// organization; an org-owned Cowork workspace is governed by its saved owner.
// Unresolved ownership fails closed.
//
// When every type is `off` (the default) each ingress hard short-circuits —
// nothing is enqueued, persisted, or uploaded. A flush partitions pending content
// by resolved scope and sends one ingest request per distinct scope.
//
// Owner scope (CAN-3515, replacing the CAN-3278 selected-context ceiling):
// activity counts only in the scope that owns the work, whatever the sidebar
// shows. Work in an organization-owned workspace (converted, set up from the
// catalog, org Cowork, an org's default Chats) goes only to that organization;
// Personal work, including a Personal checkout of a repository an org also
// tracks, stays private. The sidebar selection is never captured, and it
// neither chooses nor caps a destination (`resolveTelemetryDeliveryTarget`).
//
// Items carry no captured context. At flush the owner and current policy are
// re-evaluated per item, so anything queued earlier, including legacy queue
// lines stamped with a selection by older builds, lands where the work belongs.
// The one explicit destination is a shared container's anchor registration,
// which names the organization the member chose; it carries the worktree
// envelope only. Membership, billing, the org's enforced policy, the member's
// per-kind preferences, and the CAN-2948 ownership gates still apply, and
// unresolved ownership still uploads nothing.
//
// Per-owner rows: the server keys Workspace/Worktree by
// (createdByUserId, clientLocalId) and freezes owner scope, so one id cannot be
// shared across owners (the second target would 409). Each non-private target
// therefore gets its OWN namespaced clientLocalId (`scopedClampedId`), yielding
// one set of server rows per owner. That per-owner duplication is inherent: the
// server encrypts bodies with owner scope mixed into the AAD, so the same
// content stored for two owners is two distinct ciphertexts and cannot be
// deduplicated server-side. `private` keeps the bare id for backward
// compatibility.

   * referenced rows are guaranteed to exist server-side even when ambient sync
   * is Off. Rows are ingested at USER/private owner scope; the user/team/org
   * grant is a separate `SharedRun` created by the run-share orchestration.
   *
   * Returns the share-namespaced `{ workspaceLocalId, worktreeLocalId }` the

   * exactly them), `no-activity` when the session has no finished turns or the
   * worktree metadata cannot be resolved, or `blocked-by-org-policy` when an
   * org prohibits the data this path would upload.
   *
   * BACKSTOP GUARD. Because this path bypasses the ambient gate on purpose, a
   * prohibition has to be enforced explicitly here — `this.sharing` is never
   * consulted. `transcripts` or `metadata` prohibited refuses outright (the
   * whole point of a shared run is its transcript, and the worktree/turn
   * envelope IS metadata); a `plans` prohibition only strips the plans
   * collection, since the run itself is still shareable without it.
   * `getShareRunEligibility` gates the same thing earlier so the UI can explain
   * it before the user picks an audience; this guard covers every other caller.
