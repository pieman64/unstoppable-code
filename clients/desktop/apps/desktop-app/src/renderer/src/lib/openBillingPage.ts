/**
 * The single in-flight availability read, shared by everyone who asks at once.
 *
 * Closing the cloud gate wakes several independent readers on the same event —
 * `ModelRecoveryModal`'s gate-close `refreshAccountRead`, `GetAiCreditsCta`'s
 * post-connect coverage check, and the gate's own re-check. Each used to issue
 * its own IPC read, and two reads of the same account CAN disagree: the credits
 * fan-out is network-backed, and a transient org-credit failure degrades to
 * "uncovered" rather than to an error. That let the modal conclude *covered*
 * and commit while the CTA concluded *uncovered* and opened a billing page for
 * the credits the user had just been granted.
 *
 * ONE ANSWER PER EPISODE is the guarantee. Sharing only the *in-flight* promise
 * would make agreement a timing coincidence: the modal reads availability before
 * account state, while the CTA's post-connect read waits behind a
 * `loadCanopyCloudAccount()` hop, so a fast first read settles during that hop
 * and the second reader issues its own — reopening the disagreement whenever the
 * two answers differ. So the SETTLED RESULT is retained for the episode too, not
 * just the pending promise.
 *
 * Be precise about what that does and does not promise. Readers within one
 * episode always agree. An episode can also END between two readers — on an
 * account change, a gate close, or credit exhaustion from another chat — and
 * then the second reader correctly gets a *different, newer* answer rather than
 * a shared stale one. That is the intended behavior, not a hole: the two are
 * answering questions about different account states. What can never happen is
 * two readers disagreeing about the *same* state, or an answer surviving the
 * state it described.
 *
 * AN EPISODE IS AN ACCOUNT EPOCH, which is what keeps retention safe rather
 * than merely cheap. "In flight" alone is the wrong key: this read fans out per
 * org over the network under a multi-second budget, and `GetAiCreditsCta` seeds
 * one the moment it mounts — so a read STARTED as a guest can still be joined
 * AFTER the user signs in. A guest's pre-sign-in answer is a plain uncovered
 * result carrying no `inconclusive` marker, so joining it post-connect
 * reintroduces the exact bug this helper was added to prevent, only now with
 * both readers confidently agreeing on the previous account. The inverse is
 * just as bad: a stale *covered* answer committing a recovery under an account
 * that no longer holds the credits.
 *
 * Every read is therefore stamped with the epoch it began in, and the epoch is
 * bumped by anything that can change the answer: a cloud-account change, the
 * connect gate closing, and every caller that explicitly asks for a fresh read.
 * A reader from an older epoch never inherits an answer about somebody else.
 *
 * RETENTION IS BOUNDED THREE WAYS, because a retained answer about money is
 * only safe while it is still true:
 *
 * 1. Every decision point that needs current truth — **Try again**, **Check
 *    again**, the post-purchase focus probe, the start of each purchase
 *    attempt, and the recovery modal's opening read — passes `{ fresh: true }`,
 *    which opens a new episode. Without that, retention would silently defeat
 *    the post-purchase re-probe, whose entire job is to notice that the answer
 *    just changed.
 * 2. Anything that changes the answer ends the episode: a cloud-account change,
 *    the connect gate closing, and credit exhaustion mid-session.
 * 3. {@link SHARED_READ_MAX_AGE_MS} is the backstop for everything nobody
 *    thought of. It mirrors `useAiCreditsAvailability`'s TTL for the same
 *    stated reason — a stale value must not be able to outlive the session
 *    because some future flow forgot to invalidate. Two review rounds of this
 *    change were spent on exactly that class of miss, so the episode is capped
 *    rather than trusted.
