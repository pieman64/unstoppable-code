/**
 * Shared copy for the guest sign-in CTAs.
 *
 * The sidebar guest pill, the account-menu sign-in row, and the cloud-connect
 * gate title all render the same short label, and the two long-form blurbs are
 * the only places the benefit is spelled out. They were hand-maintained
 * literals in four files and had already drifted apart; keeping them here is
 * what stops that from happening again.
 *
 * Tone rule for anything added here: lead with the outcome the guest gets, not
 * the name of the feature that delivers it. A capability name means nothing to
 * someone who has never seen the capability, and "sync" on its own is an
 * undifferentiated safety benefit every tool claims.
 *
 * Second tone rule, learned from the subtitle that used to live here ("Your 5
 * free AI credits are already available."): never state a perk as something the
 * guest has ALREADY been given. On a conversion surface that is an argument
 * against converting. State it as what the account keeps giving them. (The
 * daily free AI Credits used to be that row in `DEFAULT_CLOUD_AUTH_BENEFITS`;
 * the row is gone because the drip is now opt-in, so signing in alone does not
 * deliver it.)
 *
 * Third tone rule, and the expensive one: the perk named here must be something
 * the guest does not already have. An earlier version of the sign-in label
 * offered free Codex, which a guest can already get — the daily AI-credit drip
 * is opt-in on the same terms for guests and signed-in free accounts alike
 * (`dailyDripCapCredits`, off until the user turns it on),
 * `loadAiCreditsRoutingContext` has no guest exclusion, and the OpenAI forward
 * route admits on a funded ledger with no `isAnonymous` check. Signing in
 * neither grants the credits nor turns them on. A CTA that asks
 * for a signup in exchange for something the reader already has is worse than
 * a vague one. Check the gate before writing the promise.

 *
 * Deliberately general. Per the tone rules above it must not promise a perk a
 * guest already has, and a brand-specific promise (the mobile app) would be
 * wrong for builds that ship none.
 *
 * Both surfaces render it in a fixed-height single-line row that truncates, so
 * keep any replacement short: the sidebar pill has ~164px for the label at the
 * 220px minimum sidebar width, and the account menu has ~176px at
 * its current `w-56`. The menu's budget is the binding one — that dropdown is a
 * fixed width and does not grow with the sidebar, so a label that overflows it
 * is elided for every user, at every window size, forever.
 *
 * This label is also the accessible name of both controls, so an elided one is
 * not merely ugly: a voice-control user cannot speak a label they cannot read
 * in full (WCAG 2.5.3, Label in Name). `guest-sign-in-cta-fit.spec.mjs` asserts
 * it fits; run it after changing this string.
