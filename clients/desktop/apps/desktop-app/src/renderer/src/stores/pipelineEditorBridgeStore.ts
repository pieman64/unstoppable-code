 * raw YAML mode keeps its own state inside `usePipelineEditorSession`
 * (`rawYamlText`, `rawYamlError`, `rawYamlBaselineRef`, `applyRawYaml`,
 * `isRawMode = editor.mainView === 'raw'`). Without bundling these, a
 * `get_current` would ignore unsaved raw-textarea edits and a `set_yaml`
 * would leave the visible textarea stale (its next view-switch would clobber
 * the agent's change). Every member is a getter/mutator that reads the latest
 * value so the bridge always sees current state even though the adapter object
 * itself is registered once.
