 * Shared between the blocking sign-in wall / connect modal (`CloudAuthPanel`)

 * same state — a credential this build wrote and can no longer decrypt — and
 * both must offer exactly one reset implementation, so the copy, the
 * confirmation, and the busy handling live here rather than being restated per
 * host.
 *
 * This is a permanent surface, deliberately not gated behind any migration
 * marker: an OS keychain reset, a profile/machine migration, or genuine on-disk
 * corruption can make the current build's own credential unreadable at any
 * time, long after the shared-secure-storage cause is gone.
 *
 * The reset action stays `secondary`: it removes downloaded data and signs the
 * user out, and its `destructive` weight belongs to the confirmation dialog,
 * not to an accent-colored button inside the notice.
