/**
 * Reopens an activity rail that Canopy — not the user — collapsed by default
 * (CAN-2836), the first time a code worktree produces work worth showing.
 * Cowork rails never reopen themselves (CAN-4793): a finished reply must not
 * narrow the chat, so the user opens the rail from its collapsed edge bar.
 *
 * The decision lives on the persisted `collapsed` descriptor itself
 * (`PanelCollapsedState.auto`), so it needs no side-channel marker and no
 * module-level latch: the flag IS the latch, and whichever expand spends it —
 * this one or the user's own click — clears `collapsed` outright. A rail the
 * user collapsed by hand carries no flag and is never reopened.
 *
 * The hook lives in `SharedActivityPanelAdapter` so the content signal and the
 * rendered rail cannot drift: it consumes the very same `sectionHasContent`
 * map the shared panel renders from. That works while the rail is shut because
 * a collapsed group's content stays mounted — the body is hidden with CSS only
 * (`PanelContentRoot`/`panels.css`) — and `usePanelPlacement()` supplies the
 * real group id, which is what makes Minimal (Work) mode work through the same
 * code path even though its rail is `group-extras`.
 *
 * Scope: the full rail only. A single activity section dragged out as its own
 * `activity-card` panel has no adapter, so it neither triggers nor receives an
 * auto-expand.
