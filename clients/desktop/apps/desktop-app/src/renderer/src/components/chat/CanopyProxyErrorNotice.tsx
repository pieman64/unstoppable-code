 * Copy rules (CAN-2413): the whole path is named "the AI provider" in every
 * row. The internal split between the local proxy, the hosted proxy, and the
 * gateway is real in the code and meaningless to a customer, so none of
 * "gateway", "proxy", or "upstream" appears here. "AI Credits" stays out of the
 * failure copy too, since it names a balance the user buys rather than the
 * thing that just failed; the only billing language is the reconnect action,
 * which points at the account.
 *
 * No HTTP status, no attempt count, no elapsed time, and no raw JSON reaches
 * the UI. Those live in the diagnostics sink, and the correlation id rendered
 * underneath is the bridge between what the user sees and what we recorded.
 *
 * Four codes are documented exceptions to the "AI Credits stays out of the
 * failure copy" rule above, each because who pays is precisely what failed:
 * `no_billing_source` (the empty balance), `guest_model_not_allowed` (signing
 * in changes who pays), `work_owner_not_member` (the work belongs to an
 * organization the user has left, CAN-3462), and `model_locked` (the model
 * needs a first AI Credit purchase, CAN-4028). For every other code the balance
 * is beside the point. The list is kept in `docs/ux-writing.md` under "AI
 * provider failure notices".
