 * Cases A, B and C, plus the two existing banners, all end in the same place:
 * `requestConnect` → `openBillingPage` → either Billing opens inside Settings
 * (the CTA returns to idle) or the user leaves for the browser → they come
 * back → we reprobe and either commit or keep waiting. Which of the two a
 * click may open is the host's `billingDestination`: overlay hosts keep
 * `'auto'` (Settings when it can open), while the inline chat banners pass
 * `'browser'` so the purchase stays tracked in the chat (CAN-5159). Implementing
 * that per branch is how coverage detection, throttling, cache invalidation and
 * `CANOPY_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_CHANGED_EVENT` get subtly wrong in four places at once,
 * so it lives here and takes only what actually varies.
 *
 * `onCovered` is the ONLY behavioral seam, which is why case C reuses this
 * verbatim: C flips `billing.onChange('ai-credits')` where A/B commit a model.
